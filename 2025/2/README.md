Please see [advent of code 2025 day 2 part 2](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2). Needs login for puzzle inputs.
Note that the input is the same as part 1
Use `make 2` to run

### Time to run
Note: Solutions are not optimal so they will take a bit of time to complete.
Lack of progress might make it feel like the program is stuck.
See table below for expected time.
If you need to see interim output, do print on line input. for eg: `print $0`
